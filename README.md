# 📚 ResearchMind-AI

ResearchMind-AI is an AI-powered research paper analysis platform that enables users to upload research papers, generate summaries, compare multiple papers, retrieve relevant information using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and interact with a Local Large Language Model (LLM) for intelligent research assistance.

The platform is designed to simplify the process of understanding research papers by providing AI-driven insights, comparisons, and question-answering capabilities.
